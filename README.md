# CodeWars

My solutions of CodeWars challanges.

My profile in codewars can be found [here](https://www.codewars.com/users/mbpixels)

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

As stated above, this repo includes my own solutions and just posting them helps me keep the pace, code on a daily basis, and improve as a developer. But..., **please do not use them** to cheat on the platform! In this regard, I deeply encourage you to pay attention to the following guidelines:

* Codewarriors are strongly encouraged not to look at my solutions to Kata until they have completed it themselves or at least took the time to think about their own approaches.
* Codewarriors should not submit my solutions as their own.
* I will not be accepting contributions of any form to this repo.
* Creating a repository like this is discouraged by Codewars.
